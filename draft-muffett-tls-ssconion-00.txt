1.  Introduction

   TBD

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   In this document, ".onion name" is to be interpreted as described in
   section 1 of [RFC7686].

   In this document "base .onion name" is interpreted to mean the
   lowercase canonical representation of a valid .onion name, shorn of
   any/all subdomain labels and of the ".onion" label; for example the
   base .onion name of "www.foo.facebookcorewwwi.onion" is
   "facebookcorewwwi".

   In this document "wildcard .onion name" is interpreted to mean a name
   which comprises three or more labels, where:

   o  the leftmost label is wholly an asterisk ("*")

   o  the rightmost label is "onion"

   o  the second-to-rightmost label is a "base .onion name"

   o  if the asterisk comprising the leftmost label were replaced with
      the single character "A", the resulting whole would conform with
      DNS name syntax as defined in Section 3.5 of [RFC1034] and
      Section 2.1 of [RFC1123].

2.1.  Rationale

   TBD

2.2.  Certificate Fields

   All fields that are described in this section MUST be present for a
   "Self-Signed TLS Certificate for Onion Services" to be valid.

   All fields which are not described in this section MUST NOT exist in
   such a certificate.

2.2.1.  Signature Algorithm

   The signature algorithm must conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.1.2

2.2.1.1.  Signature Algorithm Considerations

   Tor implements perfect forward security at the transport layer; in
   the spirit of this, and given the narrow and legacy-free nature of
   clients which will implement this standard, it would appear
   retrogressive to implement anything that does not also meet that
   functionality.

   Therefore we propose that all certificates under this standard SHOULD
   be signed with ECDSA.  TODO: Can we tighten this up to kill sucky
   algorithms?

2.2.2.  Signature Value

   The Signature Value field MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.1.3

2.2.3.  Version

   The version field MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.2.1

2.2.4.  Serial Number

   The Serial Number MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.2.2

   From section 4.1.2.2, "The serial number MUST be a positive integer
   ... It MUST be unique for each certificate ... MUST NOT use
   serialNumber values longer than 20 octets"

   In the spirit of that specification, we propose that the serial
   number be constructed as the hex digest of:

   Digest ( BaseOnionName NotBefore NotAfter )

   ...where the following applies:

   o  Digest is MD5

   o  BaseOnionName is the "base .onion name" (qv) of the Subject
      CommonName

   o  NotBefore and NotAfter are from the certificate Validity and are
      represented in ASCII GeneralizedTime Zulu

Internet-Draft                     I-D                      January 2018


   Thus a serial number for a certificate valid from midnight 1 January
   2018 UTC to 13:14:15 on 30 June 2019 UTC for
   "www.facebookcorewwwi.onion" would be:

   md5("facebookcorewwwi20180101000000Z20190630131415Z")

   = A8:E2:59:98:F0:2B:E1:40:F6:D2:18:29:8B:68:BB:EA

2.2.4.1.  Serial Number Considerations

   o  should we roll the public key into the digest, somehow?

   o  should we digest with 20-octet-truncated SHA256 instead?

2.2.5.  Issuer

   The CommonName for the Issuer MUST be the 29-character ASCII string:
   "Self-Signed Onion Certificate".

   Other Issuer fields MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.2.4
   conforming to CA/B-Forum BRs for DV Certificates.

2.2.6.  Validity

   The certificate validity MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.2.5

2.2.7.  Subject

   The CommonName for the Subject MUST be identical to the first DNS
   Name from the list of Subject Alternative Names.

   All other Subject fields MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.1.2.6,
   and MUST also conform with extant CA/B-Forum BRs for DV Certificate
   Subjects.

2.2.8.  Subject Public Key Info

   The Subject Public Key MUST conform with [RFC5280] section 4.2.1.7

2.2.8.1.  Subject Public Key Info Considerations

   o  Per discussion for Signature Algorithm above, it is RECOMMENDED
      that the Subject Public Key Algorithm should be "Elliptic Curve
      Public Key" of length 256.

   o  TODO: It would be nice to tighten this up a bit.

2.2.9.  Extensions

   The Extensions MUST contain a Subject Alternative Name extension.

   All other Extensions MUST be excluded.

2.2.9.1.  Subject Alternative Names

   Requirements:

   o  The Subject Alternative Names MUST only contain "DNS names".

   o  At least one "DNS name" MUST be given.

   o  The given "DNS names" MAY be ".onion names".

   o  The given "DNS names" MAY be "wildcard .onion names"

   o  The given "DNS names" MUST NOT be other than a ".onion name" or
      "wildcard .onion name".

2.2.9.2.  Subject Alternative Names Considerations

   o  Should we set a maximum number?

2.3.  Security Considerations

2.3.1.  Transitive Trust

   General-purpose HTTP/HTTPS is being extended such that a existing
   browser connection to "www.foo.com" will be reused for requests to
   "www.bar.com" in the instance that "www.bar.com" matches a Subject
   Alternative Name that was provided by the TLS certificate which
   authenticated "www.foo.com".

   This arrangement, under a realm of self-signed certificates, would
   present an obvious security risk of violation of trust roots in Onion
   networking.

   Therefore, for the avoidance of this and other similar future
   security issues:

   o  A valid Self-Signed TLS Certificate for Onion Services MUST only
      cite a solitary "base .onion name" amongst the Subject Alternative
      Names that it lists.

Internet-Draft                     I-D                      January 2018


   o  Clients which support Self-Signed TLS Certificates for Onion
      Services MUST NOT trust certificates that cite more than one "base
      .onion name".

   TODO: if this risk is mitigated elsewhere in the specs, we could
   maybe nuke this section; the risk is in implementations which might
   unwisely trust a Self-Signed TLS Certificate for Onion Services.  The
   above does appear to be a desirably robust solution, however.

2.3.2.  Onion Name Types

   At the time of writing, "base .onion names" are of two types:

   o  "old" .onion names, being encodings of truncated SHA-1 hashes

   o  "new" or "next generation" names, being encodings of X25519 keys
      and metadata

   This standard SHALL NOT prohibit generation of Self-Signed TLS
   Certificates for Onion Services for either of these, nor for future,
   types of .onion name.

   Clients SHOULD implement fine-grained checks to distingush, and to
   eventually deprecate, legacy types of .onion name.
